{\bf DESCRIPTION}
\end{center}  
An introductory survey of financial institutions and their respective roles. The
learning outcomes for this course are summarized below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Understanding the role of financial markets and institutions in promoting economic
growth. 
\item Introduce the Federal reserve and the U.S. monetary system as well as the reasoning,
method, and effect of open market operations on money and capital markets.
\item Compare and contrast the roles of money, capital (debt and equity), and derivative markets.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{center}
{\bf ACADEMIC HONESTY POLICY}
\end{center} 
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated in this class. Cheating
on quizzes, examinations, and other forms of dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, collusion, and
falsification of data) will be dealt with in a serious and formal manner. The penalty for academic
dishonesty in this class will be course failure. That is, any student who is found to be cheating
or engaged in other academically dishonest behavior will be failed for this course for this
semester. Course withdrawals to avoid such a failure will not be permitted. As a student, you
have a responsibility to become familiar with the Academic Honesty Policy found in the {\it Student
Rights, Regulations, and Procedures Handbook}.\\

\begin{center}
{\bf EXAMS} 
\end{center}
There will be three exams (two during the semester and a final exam). Normally no make-up exams will be given.  Failure to take an exam will result in a grade of zero for the missed exam.  Make-up exams will only be allowed for {\it extraordinary} and {\it verifiable} reasons.\\
\begin{center}
{\bf HOMEWORK} 
\end{center}
There will be three homework assignments during the semester. The three homework assignments will be due the week before each exam. Each homework will be worth 3 and 1/3 final grade points. Late homework will not be accepted.
% \begin{center}
% {\bf PAPERS} 
% \end{center}
% One short paper will be due on the last day of class. You may choose your topic
% from a list of four (or possibly more topics if new ones arise during the semester). Also, if
% you have a particular topic on which you would like to write, relating to financial markets or
% institutions, then you may request this topic from the instructor. The paper should be no more
% than 5 pages double spaced. You will be graded on the clarity, concision, and thoughtfulness
% of your writing, and not on the amount of words you have put on paper. A list of four possible
% topics, as well as source files for these topics, is available in the content section of D2L.
\begin{center}
{\bf PROJECT -- Not Required This Semester}
\end{center}
Students will either:

\begin{itemize}
\item Create a Shiny interactive web application.  To do so you'll first need to sign up for a free \href{https://www.shinyapps.io/}{\textcolor{blue}{shinyapps}} account.  

You are free to create the account under a pseudonym, so no one can publicly identify you as the owner of the account.  However, the web application is a useful tool to show off your work, and is something that can go on your resume (with a link to the application).  So you may prefer to use your real name.  My user name is `mattbrigida'.  

Your application should have something to do with currency markets, and should be at least somewhat original.  See a gallery of applications here:  \href{http://shiny.rstudio.com/}{\textcolor{blue}{shiny.rstudio}}. Possible applications may be:
\begin{itemize}
\item Plot a time series of interest rates.
\item Plot the relationship of mortgage to inflation or interest rates.
\item A mortgage payment calculator.
\item Duration calculator.
\item Create a histogram or probability density plot for bond or stock returns.
\end{itemize}
To get started you will want to use the RStudio development environment for R.  This is available in the Still hall computer lab, or you can install it for free on your own computer from here:  \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{\textcolor{blue}{download}}.  If you install it on your own computer you'll need to install R first.  You can get R here:  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{\textcolor{blue}{download}}

\item Write a paper summarizing a topic relevant to the course.  A set of documents will be posted in which you may be able to find relevant topics.  The paper should be long enough to cover the topic, but should not contain irrelevant filler.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
{\bf COURSE COMMUNICATION}
\end{center}
Course Communication: All important/official announcements will either be posted on Desire2Learn
or emailed to each student's Clarion University email account. I will post helpful information
to: \href{http://www.complete-markets.com}{\textcolor{green}{Complete Markets}}. To see information relating to your course type ``FIN 375'' in
the search bar on the web page. Some examples of helpful information are
spreadsheets which assist in studying for exams or completing homeworks, answers to questions
other students have asked (of course I will not include who asked the question), and useful \href{http://www.r-project.org}{\textcolor{green}{R}} code. \\

{\bf An Important Note on Grading}
\end{center}
There is no special consideration if you need a certain grade in this course to graduate.  {\bf If you require a certain grade in this class to graduate it is your responsibility to earn that grade.} Specifically if you receive a `D' in this course I will not allow you to do extra assignments after the course is complete in exchange for a higher grade.
